// Intentionally not exported:
//  - Image, decodeImageFromDataPipe, decodeImageFromList:
//      We use ui.* to make it very explicit that these are low-level image APIs.
//      Generally, higher layers provide more reasonable APIs around images.
//  - lerpDouble:
//      Hopefully this will eventually become Double.lerp.
//  - Paragraph, ParagraphBuilder, ParagraphStyle, TextBox:
//      These are low-level text primitives. Use this package's TextPainter API.
//  - Picture, PictureRecorder, Scene, SceneBuilder:
//      These are low-level primitives. Generally, the rendering layer makes these moot.
//  - Gradient:
//      Use this package's higher-level Gradient API instead.
//  - window, WindowPadding
//      These are generally wrapped by other APIs so we always refer to them directly
//      as ui.* to avoid making them seem like high-level APIs.
