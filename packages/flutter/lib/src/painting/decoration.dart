/// A description of a box decoration (a decoration applied to a [Rect]).
///
/// This class presents the abstract interface for all decorations.
/// See [BoxDecoration] for a concrete example.
///
/// To actually paint a [Decoration], use the [createBoxPainter]
/// method to obtain a [BoxPainter]. [Decoration] objects can be
/// shared between boxes; [BoxPainter] objects can cache resources to
/// make painting on a particular surface faster.

  /// Abstract const constructor. This constructor enables subclasses to provide
  /// const constructors so that they can be used in const expressions.
  const Decoration();

  /// In checked mode, throws an exception if the object is not in a
  /// valid configuration. Otherwise, returns true.
  ///
  /// This is intended to be used as follows:
  /// ```dart
  ///   assert(myDecoration.debugAssertIsValid());
  /// ```
  bool debugAssertIsValid() => true;

  /// Returns the insets to apply when using this decoration on a box
  /// that has contents, so that the contents do not overlap the edges
  /// of the decoration. For example, if the decoration draws a frame
  /// around its edge, the padding would return the distance by which
  /// to inset the children so as to not overlap the frame.

  ///
  /// This defers to [end]'s [lerpTo] function if [end] is not null,
  /// otherwise it uses [begin]'s [lerpFrom] function.

  /// otherwise.
  bool hitTest(Size size, Point position) => true;

  /// Returns a [BoxPainter] that will paint this decoration.

/// A stateful class that can paint a particular [Decoration].
///
/// [BoxPainter] objects can cache resources so that they can be used
/// multiple times.
///
/// Some resources used by [BoxPainter] may load asynchronously. When this
/// happens, the [onChanged] callback will be invoked. To stop this callback
/// from being called after the painter has been discarded, call [dispose].

  /// Abstract const constructor. This constructor enables subclasses to provide
  /// const constructors so that they can be used in const expressions.

  /// Paints the [Decoration] for which this object was created on the
  /// given canvas using the given configuration.
  ///
  /// The [ImageConfiguration] object passed as the third argument must, at a
  /// minimum, have a non-null [Size].
  ///
  /// If this object caches resources for painting (e.g. [Paint] objects), the
  /// cache may be flushed when [paint] is called with a new configuration. For
  /// this reason, it may be more efficient to call
  /// [Decoration.createBoxPainter] for each different rectangle that is being
  /// painted in a particular frame.
  ///
  /// For example, if a decoration's owner wants to paint a particular
  /// decoration once for its whole size, and once just in the bottom
  /// right, it might get two [BoxPainter] instances, one for each.
  /// However, when its size changes, it could continue using those
  /// same instances, since the previous resources would no longer be
  /// relevant and thus losing them would not be an issue.

  /// rectangle whose top left corner is at the given `offset` and whose size is
  /// given by `configuration.size`.

  /// decoration finishes loading. For example, an image. When this is invoked,
  /// the [paint] method should be called again.

  /// Resources might not start to load until after [paint] has been called,
  /// because they might depend on the configuration.
