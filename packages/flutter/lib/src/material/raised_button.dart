/// A material design "raised button".
///
/// A raised button consists of a rectangular piece of material that hovers over
/// the interface.
///
/// Use raised buttons to add dimension to otherwise mostly flat layouts, e.g.
/// in long busy lists of content, or in wide spaces. Avoid using raised buttons
/// on already-raised content such as dialogs or cards.
///
/// If the [onPressed] callback is null, then the button will be disabled and by
/// default will appear like a flat button in the [disabledColor]. If you are
/// trying to change the button's [color] and it is not having any effect, check
/// that you are passing a non-null [onPressed] handler.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// If you want an ink-splash effect for taps, but don't want to use a button,
/// consider using [InkWell] directly.
///
/// Raised buttons will expand to fit the child widget, if necessary.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [FlatButton], a material design button without a shadow.
///  * [DropdownButton], a button that shows options to select from.
///  * [FloatingActionButton], the round button in material applications.
///  * [IconButton], to create buttons that just contain icons.
///  * [InkWell], which implements the ink splash part of a flat button.
