/// A material design "raised button".
///
/// A raised button consists of a rectangular piece of material that hovers over
/// the interface.
///
/// Use raised buttons to add dimension to otherwise mostly flat layouts, e.g.
/// in long busy lists of content, or in wide spaces. Avoid using raised buttons
/// on already-raised content such as dialogs or cards.
///
/// If the [onPressed] callback is not specified or null, then the button will
/// be disabled and by default will appear like a flat button in the
/// [disabledColor]. If you are trying to change the button's [color] and it is
/// not having any effect, check that you are passing a non-null [onPressed]
/// handler.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [FlatButton]
///  * [DropdownButton]
///  * [FloatingActionButton]
