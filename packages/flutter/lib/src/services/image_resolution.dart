/// Fetches an image from an [AssetBundle], having determined the exact image to
/// use based on the context.
///
/// Given a main asset and a set of variants, AssetImage chooses the most
/// appropriate asset for the current context, based on the device pixel ratio
/// and size given in the configuration passed to [resolve].
///
/// To show a specific image from a bundle without any asset resolution, use an
/// [AssetBundleImageProvider].
///
/// ## Naming assets for matching with different pixel densities
///
/// Main assets are presumed to match a nominal pixel ratio of 1.0. To specify
/// assets targeting different pixel ratios, place the variant assets in
/// the application bundle under subdirectories named in the form "Nx", where
/// N is the nominal device pixel ratio for that asset.
///
/// For example, suppose an application wants to use an icon named
/// "heart.png". This icon has representations at 1.0 (the main icon), as well
/// as 1.5 and 2.0 pixel ratios (variants). The asset bundle should then contain
/// the following assets:
///
/// ```
/// heart.png
/// 1.5x/heart.png
/// 2.0x/heart.png
/// ```
///
/// On a device with a 1.0 device pixel ratio, the image chosen would be
/// heart.png; on a device with a 1.3 device pixel ratio, the image chosen
/// would be 1.5x/heart.png.
///
/// The directory level of the asset does not matter as long as the variants are
/// at the equivalent level; that is, the following is also a valid bundle
/// structure:
///
/// ```
/// icons/heart.png
/// icons/1.5x/heart.png
/// icons/2.0x/heart.png
/// ```
