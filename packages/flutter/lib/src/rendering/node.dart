/// An abstract node in a tree
///
/// AbstractNode has as notion of depth, attachment, and parent, but does not
/// have a model for children.
///
/// * When a subclass is changing the parent of a child, it should
///   call either parent.adoptChild(child) or parent.dropChild(child)
///   as appropriate. Subclasses should expose an API for
///   manipulating the tree if you want to (e.g. a setter for a
///   'child' property, or an 'add()' method to manipulate a list).
///
/// * You can see the current parent by querying 'parent'.
///
/// * You can see the current attachment state by querying
///   'attached'. The root of any tree that is to be considered
///   attached should be manually attached by calling 'attach()'.
///   Other than that, don't call 'attach()' or 'detach()'. This is
///   all managed automatically assuming you call the 'adoptChild()'
///   and 'dropChild()' methods appropriately.
///
/// * Subclasses that have children must override 'attach()' and
///   'detach()' as described below.
///
/// * Nodes always have a 'depth' greater than their ancestors'.
///   There's no guarantee regarding depth between siblings. The
///   depth of a node is used to ensure that nodes are processed in
///   depth order. The 'depth' of a child can be more than one
///   greater than the 'depth' of the parent, because the 'depth'
///   values are never decreased: all that matters is that it's
///   greater than the parent. Consider a tree with a root node A, a
///   child B, and a grandchild C. Initially, A will have 'depth' 0,
///   B 'depth' 1, and C 'depth' 2. If C is moved to be a child of A,
///   sibling of B, then the numbers won't change. C's 'depth' will
///   still be 2. This is all managed automatically assuming you call
///   'adoptChild()' and 'dropChild()' appropriately.
